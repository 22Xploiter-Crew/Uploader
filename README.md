Uploader whose extension can be changed via url to .txt or .php And it can't be indexed by Google or found by anyone, because the status code is 404

If you want to change the file extension, you don't need to rename this uploader. all you have to do is change the extension via utl, for example:
https://randsx.com/uploader.php to https://randsx.com/uploader.txt
